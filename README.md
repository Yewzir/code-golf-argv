# Accessing command-line arguments in my local environment

<p align="justify">
  This repository serves as a helper for the holes on <a href="https://code.golf/">Code Golf</a> being executed with command-line arguments.
  Per such hole are two text files, <b>argv.txt</b> and <b>stdout.txt</b>. The former contains a list of command-line arguments that were
  extracted from the hole, and the latter contains the corresponding output for solving a hole with those arguments. Why? Basically, I have
  had my fair share of rage when I had to create a list of command-line arguments while implementing some solutions in my local environment.
  In the event I forget to pay the internet provider, or Docker's <s>on its period</s> letting me down, this too will prevent me from pulling
  out my hair.
