"In mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or simply hex)\nnumeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a\nradix (base) of 16. Unlike the decimal system representing numbers using 10\nsymbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols \"0\"-\"9\"\nto represent values 0 to 9, and \"A\"-\"F\" (or alternatively \"a\"-\"f\") to represent\nvalues from 10 to 15.\n\nSoftware developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because\nthey provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Each\nhexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble\n(or nybble). For example, an 8-bit byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to\n11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in\nhexadecimal."
